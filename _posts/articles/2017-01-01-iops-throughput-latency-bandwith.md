**Throughput** is a measure of the amount of data that can be pushed through a common point in the data path in a given time. A similar term is “**bandwidth**”, which represents the ability to support a given level of throughput. both are typically expressed as **bits per second** in networking terminology and as **bytes per second** in storage terminology
