# 2. Introduction
Embark is a **framework** that allows you to easily **develop and deploy Decentralized Applications** (DApps).

A Decentralized Application is a serverless html5 application that uses one or more decentralized technologies.

Embark currently integrates with EVM blockchains (**Ethereum**), Decentralized Storages (**IPFS**), and Decentralized communication platforms (**Whisper** and **Orbit**). **Swarm** is supported for deployment.

With Embark you can:

**Blockchain (Ethereum)**
- Automatically deploy contracts and make them available in your JS code. Embark watches for changes, and if you update a contract, Embark will automatically redeploy the contracts (if needed) and the dapp.
- Contracts are available in JS with Promises.
- Do Test Driven Development with Contracts using Javascript.
- Keep track of deployed contracts; deploy only when truly needed.
- Manage different chains (e.g testnet, private net, livenet)
- Easily manage complex systems of interdependent contracts.


**Decentralized Storage (IPFS)**
- Easily Store & Retrieve Data on the DApp through EmbarkJS. Including uploading and retrieving files.
- Deploy the full application to IPFS or Swarm.

Decentralized Communication (Whisper, Orbit)
- Easily send/receive messages through channels in P2P through Whisper or Orbit.

**Web Technologies**
- Integrate with any web technology including React, Foundation, etc..
- Use any build pipeline or tool you wish, including grunt, gulp and webpack.
