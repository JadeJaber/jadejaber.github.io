We are going to discuss in this article about the following concepts :
- Public/Private keys
- Certificates
- SHA algorithms
- RSA algorithms
- SSH
- Signature

> Any comments are welcomed, I'm not an expert, I'm just trying to sum up the why and how of those elements.


## Private & Publis keys & asymetric cryptography
**Definition** : Private and public keys are randomly generated characters. They are used to encrypt and decrypt messages. The privte key is never revealed to anyone whereas the public key may publicly revealed. 

A message encrypted with a private key may only be decrypted with the associated public key and vice versa. This is what we call **asymmetric cryptography**. Which means that only the messages which are encrypted with the public key are "secret" since the ones that are encrypted with the private key may decrypted by anyone who owns the public key which is publicly available.

A public/private key may be generated with such a command : 
```shell
keytool -genkey -keyalg RSA -alias ssl -keystore keystore.jks -validity 360 -storepass changeit -keypass changeit -dname "cn=hostname, ou=test, o=test, c=XX"
```

## Signature
**Definition** : A signature is a digest (generated by a hashing algorithm as SHA1) of a message which is then encrypted using a private key.
 
 ## Tools 
 - Open-ssl
-  keytool
