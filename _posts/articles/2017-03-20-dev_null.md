A process has 3 standard flows: 
- 1 input  (STDIN, typically the keyboard)
- 2 outputs (STDOUT, STDERR)


These flows are referenced by the following variables: STDIN, STDOUT et STDERR which values are  0, 1 and 2

By default, ">" will only redirect the STDOUT (not the STDERR)

```shell
$ my_command > /dev/null	
```

If we'd like to redirect only the STDERR we would use: 

```shell
$ my_command 2>/dev/null 
```

By using "2>&1", we specify that we want to redirect the STDERR on the same "channel" in which we are sendinf the STDOUT. In that case if STDOUT is redirected to /dev/null so will STDERR.

```shell
$ my_command > /dev/null 2>&1		
```
