## 1. Forking and contributing a repo

### 1.1 First contribution

1. Fork the repo from the UI

2. Clone the forked repo on your working machine  
```shell
git clone [project Git URL]Ã’
```
3. In order to make pull requests, we need to sync to our distant repo, and we need an upstream remote to do that: 
```shell
git remote add upstream [username/repo]
```

### 1.2 Next contributions

1. Go to working directory and checkout to your master branch

2. Update your local repository with the source project
```git
git pull --rebase origin master
```

### 1.3 Common procedure

1. Create a new branch for your new feature 
```shell
git checkout -b my-new-feature
```
2. Make your own modifications

3. Commit your modifications 
```shell
git add -all
git commit -m 'Add some feature'   
# OR
git commit -am 'Add some feature' 
```
4. Pull rebase the master origin into your branch 
```shell
git pull --rebase origin master
```
5. Fix conflicts and re-pull

6. Push to your upstream / branch
```git
git push upstream my-new-feature
```

7. Create a pull request on Github

8. Once the pull request is validated you may delete your branch
```shell
git branch --d my-new-feature
OR
git branch --D my-new-feature #--D is to force
```

## 2. Deleting a commit and git stash


### 2.1 Git reset
Assuming you are sitting on that commit, then this command will wack it...
```shell
git reset --hard HEAD~1
```
The HEAD~1 means the commit before head.

Or, you could look at the output of git log, find the commit id of the commit you want to back up to, and then do this:
```shell
git reset --hard <sha1-commit-id>
```

If you want to keep your current modifications you may use git stash
```shell
git stash 
```

And then retrieve your modifications using git stash commands.

### 2.2 Stash

You may list/show all your stashes
```shell
git stash --list 

git stash --show -v [stash number]
```

And then retrieve back your modifications
```shell
# by creating a new branch
git stash branch [new branch] [stash number]

# or by applying it to your current branch
git stash apply [stash number]
```
