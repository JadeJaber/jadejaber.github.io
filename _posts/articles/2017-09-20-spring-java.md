# Concepts
- Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP)
- Cross-cutting concerns : loggin, security, caching => aspects that are not related to business logic
- Dependency Injection


The key unit of modularity in OOP is the class, whereas in AOP the unit of modularity is the aspect. 
**DI** helps you decouple your application objects from each other, while **AOP** helps you decouple cross-cutting concerns from the objects that they affect.
