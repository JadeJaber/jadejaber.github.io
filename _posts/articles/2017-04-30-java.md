### Java Modifiers
- Access Modifiers − default, public , protected, private
- Non-access Modifiers − final, abstract, strictfp

### Java Variables
Following are the types of variables in Java −
- Local Variables
- Class Variables (Static Variables)
- Instance Variables (Non-static Variables)

### Java Arrays
Arrays are objects that store multiple variables of the same type. However, an array itself is an object on the heap. We will look into how to declare, construct, and initialize in the upcoming chapters.

### Java Enums
Enums were introduced in Java 5.0. Enums restrict a variable to have one of only a few predefined values. The values in this enumerated list are called enums.

### Interfaces
In Java language, an interface can be defined as a contract between objects on how to communicate with each other. Interfaces play a vital role when it comes to the concept of inheritance.

An interface defines the methods, a deriving class (subclass) should use. But the implementation of the methods is totally up to the subclass.
